## Description  

This repository contains code and data used to assess multi-dimensional recovery of tropical secondary forests (under review). This project is part of the [sUCCESS](https://www.idiv.de/de/sdiv/arbeitsgruppen/pool-of-working-groups/success.html) working group and the [2NDFOR](https://sites.google.com/view/2ndfor/home) initiative. 

Please note that the code is divided into three parts: i) Bayesian modeling of recovery of forest attributes, ii) correlation and partial correlation network analyses of recovery of forest attributes and iii) figures.  

For questions regarding the network analyses, please contact [Dylan Craven](mailto:dylan.craven@aya.yale.edu). For questions regarding the Bayesian models for recovery of forest attributes, please contact [Bruno Herault](bruno.herault@cirad.fr).
